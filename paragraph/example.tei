<p>A fly built a castle, a tall and mighty castle.
There came to the castle the Crawling Louse. <q>Who,
  who's in the castle? Who, who's in your house?</q>
said the Crawling Louse. <q>I, I, the Languishing Fly.
  And who art thou?</q>
<q>I'm the Crawling Louse.</q>
</p>
<p>Then came to the castle the Leaping Flea. <q>Who,
  who's in the castle?</q> said the Leaping Flea. <q>I,
  I, the Languishing Fly, and I, the Crawling Louse. And
  who art thou?</q>
<q>I'm the Leaping Flea.</q>
</p>
<p>Then came to the castle the Mischievous Mosquito.
<q>Who, who's in the castle?</q> said the Mischievous
Mosquito. <q>I, I, the Languishing Fly, and I, the
  Crawling Louse, and I, the Leaping Flea. And who art
  thou?</q>
<q>I'm the Mischievous Mosquito.</q>
